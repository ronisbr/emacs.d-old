My emacs.d directory
====================

This is my emacs.d directory.

I want to thanks Magnar Sveen (magnars @ github.com). My emacs.d is entirely
based on his emacs.d (https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d). Also, the videos
that he posted on YouTube (emacsrocks) was what introduced me to emacs.
